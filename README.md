# Hi, I’m Afraeim 👋

🎓 Computer Science Student
📍 Atlanta, GA  

I’m interested in mobile development, machine learning, and AI infrastructure. I enjoy building functional applications that bridge the gap between complex backend logic and smooth user experiences, with a particular focus on the Flutter ecosystem and LLM fine-tuning.

## 💻 Tech & Tools
- **Languages:** Dart, Python, C++, TypeScript
- **Mobile:** Flutter, Firebase (Auth & Cloud)
- **AI / ML:** LLM Fine-tuning (Quantized 7B), Jupyter Notebooks
- **Web:** HTML, CSS, TypeScript
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code

## 🚀 Featured Projects
- **[llm-fine-tune-quantized7B](https://github.com/afraeim/llm-fine-tune-quantized7B)** – Experimentation with fine-tuning large language models using quantization techniques to optimize performance.
- **[vmt (Vehicle Maintenance Tracker)](https://github.com/afraeim/vmt)** – A practical mobile application built to help users track and manage vehicle maintenance schedules.
- **[fire-auth](https://github.com/afraeim/fire-auth) & [fire-cloud](https://github.com/afraeim/fire-cloud)** – Implementation of robust authentication and cloud storage solutions using Firebase and C++ integration.

## 🛠️ A Little About Me
- Passionate about Mobile UI/UX and Cross-Platform development using Flutter.
- Enjoys exploring the "under the hood" of AI, specifically how to make models run on consumer hardware.
- Experienced in building diverse utility apps, from Recipe Books to Quiz platforms.
- Big fan of learning by doing my 60+ repositories reflect my journey of constant experimentation.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- Advanced LLM Fine-tuning & Optimization
- Scaling Backend Systems with Firebase
- Deepening C++ implementation for performance-critical applications
